# Human vs AI Text Classification

This project aims to classify whether a given text is written by a human or generated by AI. It uses a combination of traditional NLP techniques and machine learning models to achieve this classification.

## Dataset

The dataset is from a Kaggle competition:
- [Human vs AI Text Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/human-vs-ai-text-classification-feb2024/data)

The data is in the form of:

| text | generated |
|------|-----------|
| text | 0         |
| text | 1         |

Where `generated` is 0 for human-written text or 1 for AI-generated text.

## Features

- Text preprocessing and cleaning
- Feature extraction using TF-IDF
- Multiple machine learning models:
  - Logistic Regression (weighted and unweighted)
  - Naive Bayes
- Model evaluation and comparison
- Feature importance analysis
## Key Findings

### Summary of Feature Importances in Logistic Model for Predicting Human vs. AI-Generated Text

1. **Positive vs. Negative Coefficients:**
   - **Positive Coefficients** are associated with features that increase the likelihood of the text being AI-generated. These words or phrases tend to be more formal, structured, and indicative of AI's approach to constructing text.
   - **Negative Coefficients** are linked to features that increase the likelihood of the text being human-written. These words or phrases reflect a more casual, natural style, often involving causal explanations and contrasting ideas, characteristic of human writing.

2. **Magnitude of Coefficients:**
   - The magnitude (absolute value) of the coefficients indicates the significance of each feature in the model's predictions. Features with larger magnitudes have a stronger impact on whether the model classifies text as AI-generated or human-written.

3. **Insights:**
   - **AI-Generated Text** tends to exhibit a formal, structured style with explicit transitions and conclusions. This language is often more formulaic, emphasizing clarity and organization.
   - **Human-Written Text** displays a more casual and varied style, often using causal explanations and contrasting ideas. This reflects human creativity and a flexible approach to writing.

## Future Work
